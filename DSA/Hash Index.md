# Hash Index


Hash indexes are an integral part of databases. If you’ve ever used a database, chances are that you have seen them in action without even realizing it.

Hash indexes differ in work from other types of indexes because they store values rather than pointers to records located on a disk. This ensures faster searching and insertion into the index. That’s why hash indexes are often used as primary keys or unique identifiers.

A hash index is an index type that is most commonly used in data management. It is typically created on a column that contains unique values, such as a primary key or email address. The main benefit of using hash indexes is their fast performance.

The concept behind these indexes can be sophisticated to understand for someone who has never heard about them before. However, understanding hash indexes is important if you need to understand how databases work. It is necessary for solving common problems related to databases and their speed.

A hash index is a data structure that can be used to accelerate database queries. It works by converting input records into an array of buckets. Each bucket has the same number of records as all other buckets in the table. Thus, no matter how many different values you have for a particular column, every row will always map to one bucket.

Hash indexes allow for quick lookups on data stored in tables. They work by creating an index key from the value and then locating it based on the resulting hash. It is useful when there is a lot of input with similar values or duplicates, as it only needs to compare keys instead of looking through all records.
