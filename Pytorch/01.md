### What is Machine Learning?
The use and development of computer systems that are able to learn and adapt without following explicit
instructions, by using algorithms and statistical models to analyse and draw inferences from patterns in data.

### Branches of Machine Learning:
* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning
* Neural Networks (Deep Learning)

## Supervised Learning
In Supervised Machine Learning, our algorithms learn from labeled data. After studying the labeled data, these
techniques are able to determine which label should be given to new data based on observing patterns and
associating those patterns to new unlabeled data.

Algorithms:
• Support-Vector machines
• Linear Regression
• Logistic Regression
• Naive Bayes
• Decision Trees
• K-nearest neighbor
