# NETWORK

## scan network for other connected device
windows
arp -a

This will display the ARP table, which lists the IP addresses and MAC addresses of devices your computer has communicated with on the local network.

Note: This method wonâ€™t show all devices on the network but rather only those that your computer has interacted with.

windows
ipconfig

linux
ifconfig
