#CAP theorem


### A good design has 3 metrics
scalability - grow with its user base
maintainability - ensure future dev can understand / improve
effieciency - make good use of system resources
reliability - when things go wrong , it will not crash



### 3 key elements
moving data
storing data
transforming data 


## CAP theorem
Consistency - all nodes have the same data at the same time, make changes to 1 node, it will be reflected to all nodes
Availability - system is always operational and responsive to request
Partition Tolerance - continue functioning even if 1 node is down

### Among these 3 a distributed system can only choose 2
so you must compromise
