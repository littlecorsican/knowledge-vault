# Load Balancer

Spreads the request to multiple servers using algorithem

# Algo example
1) Round Robin 
2) Least Connection
3) Least response time
4) IP hashing
5) Geographic
6) Consistent Hashing


# Health Check
consistent checking of servers to make sure all server is online

If a server fails, traffic should not be sent to server by load balancer.
