3) anonymizing requests

### types of proxy
1) Forward Proxy - sit between client and server. 
A forward proxy acts as an intermediary between client devices and the internet, routing client requests to external servers while regulating access and enhancing security. It can also mask client IP addresses and enforce policies like content filtering.

2) Reverse proxy - sit in front of server, intercepting request from internet, use for load balancing or security layer. Difference with forward proxy is it acts on behalf of the servers. Servers hide behind the proxy server and proxy acts on behalf of the servers. So the client knows nth about the servers.
